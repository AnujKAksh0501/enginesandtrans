                        - We believe in a world where the innocence and privacy
                        of children are fiercely protected, especially in the
                        digital realm. As part of our commitment to preserving

                        use, or disclose personal information from children

                        shall take prompt action to entirely and promptly remove

                        parental or guardian consent before disclosing any
                        personal information to anyone online. In addition to

                        also serves to teach kids the value of privacy.

                        - We encourage parents to monitor their children&apos;s
                        online activity and teach them about responsible and
                        safe behaviour. Open communication between parents and
                        children about the potential dangers and pitfalls of
                        sharing personal information online, as well as guidance
                        on identifying and preventing such dangers, can

                        is a shared duty; working together can give our kids a
                        safer online experience. In addition, we support using
                        parental control features offered by software developers
                        and online service providers. These technologies can

                        from giving out their names, addresses, and other
                        personal information without their parent&apos;s

                        information, creative opportunities, and social
                        connections. It could, however, come with risks and
                        hazards. Our collaborative duty as parents, technology
                        providers, and community members is to ensure that our
                        kids may safely and securely explore the online world.
