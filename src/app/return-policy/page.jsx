          Engines & Transmissions World knows that the situation may be erratic and that,
          occasionally, you may need to cancel an order. We&apos;ve got you
          covered, so don&apos;t worry! Before receiving our formal order

          An order cannot be canceled since we want to provide quick and
          efficient service, which means once it has been verified, it is
          quickly processed for shipping. This is because we move quickly to
          make sure your car components get to you as soon as possible.

          Orders placed between Friday at 5 EST (2:00 PST) and Monday at 9 EST
          (6:00 PST) cannot be canceled. This is because we try to process

          order to look for missing, harmed, or inadvertent parts. Please
          repackage the item(s) in the original shipping container if you

          in our return policy, which are listed below:
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          1. If you receive a damaged part, then do not accept the package.
          Contact the shipper immediately and return it to the sender.

        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          2. If a damaged package is left in your absence by the shipper,
          immediately contact the shipping company to arrange its return to the
          sender.
        </p>

          email will be sent to you. Although it can take 1–7 business days for
          your banking institution to display the credit in your account, kindly
          be aware of this possibility.
